# Pin-on-Demand REST API
This document should give business partners a clear understanding of the technical integration work that needs to be carried out to successfully implement the Pin-on-Demand REST API.

The Pin-on-Demand REST API allows full control of the sales process in real-time for both parties and therefore means some integration work and thorough testing of the real-time API.

If any questions arise, please feel free to contact us at [*integration@paysafecard.com*]().

# Integration Process Overview
The following steps need to be completed in order to integrate the API.

+ **Test Data**: paysafecard provides the test data package. This contains an API key and a .conf file needed for the certificate creation (both for authentication), account details, an integration checklist, voucher texts and a link to the downloads page.
+ **IP whitelisting**: The business partner provides the IP(s) used to connect to the paysafecard system, to be whitelisted.
+ **Integration in the Test Environment**: The business partner integrates the API into their test environment. Detailed information about the flows and API requests are contained below in this documentation.
+ **Integration Test**: As soon as the integration is finished in the test environment and the integration checklist fulfilled, the business partner must contact the paysafecard integration team who will test the API implementation as well as verify the voucher samples.
+ **Reconciliation Test:** paysafecard provides an example of a reconciliation file from the test system that must be processed by the business partner.
+ **Productive Data**: Once the integration test is successful, paysafecard provides the productive data. This contains a productive environment API key and account details. 
+ **Switch to Production**: The business partner switches the integration to the production environment (change API endpoints and API key).
+ **Productive Check**: An end to end test must be carried out to ensure a successful connection to the productive environment. A new voucher sample must be provided as proof of a successful integration in the productive environment.
+ **Go-live**: As soon as the productive check is successful, the technical integration is finished and a date can be set for the go-live.

# Technical Integration
This section provides a technical introduction to the Pin-on-Demand REST API.

## About the API
The Pin-on-Demand REST API follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">*RESTful*</a> design principles making it easy to understand and integrate the API.
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture style, consisting of guidelines for creating scalable web services.

RESTful systems typically communicate over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol with the same HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used by web browsers to retrieve web pages and send data to remote servers.

It also facilitates solid and universally accepted foundations like [*http basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), [*http verbs*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods), [*JSON*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and [*CORS*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

## Versioning
Every time there is backwards-incompatible change to the API, a new major version will be released. This major version is part of the URL path.
The current major version is *v1*. Unless informed by our technical support department that we are dropping support for a particular API version, you do not need to switch API versions.

## Establishing a connection
A connection to the paysafecard system is successful if the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
- X.509 certificate for request authenticity (provided by paysafecard).
- API key for request authentication (provided by paysafecard).
- Authorization of the business partner server IP address (if a 403 error is received when trying to access the service, it is likely that the IP address is not yet allowed to access).
- Content-type: Please make sure that the content type in the HTTP header, when submitting requests, is set to **Content-Type: application/json**
- Character encoding needs to be in UTF-8

## X.509 Certificate Authenticity
paysafecard will provide the business partner with a .conf file that must be used to create a signed certificate requests ([CSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_signing_request)).
Instructions for the creation of the CSR will be provided with the test data delivery.

After successful CSR creation, paysafecard will then provide the business partner with the X.509 certificate based on this CSR, which will work on both test and productive environments.

**Important:** Please keep the private key in a safe place and do not provide it to paysafecard nor disclose it to third parties. paysafecard will never ask for the private key.

## SSL Encryption
The certificate ensures encryption of all communications.

- Only TLS 1.2 (SSL 3.3) is supported
- Weak ciphers are disabled

## API Key Authentication
Every request must be authenticated using an API key:
- The value of the **API key needs to be base64 encoded** when transmitted in the HTTP header!
- Set the key as the username. [*HTTP basic authentication*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
- Your API key may only be used from your backend systems.
- **Please note:** Your API key must be kept secured - never expose the API key to anybody!

Below is an example of how the API key is supposed to be set.

```
Authorization: Basic cHNjX0R4dThqSnI1LVdPYXhLWnpjOXdyMUtNLXd1Y3dZMXg=
```

## Test Environment and Endpoints
Every new business partner needs to first integrate the Paysafecash API on the test environment.
Once the integration is finished, a UAT(User Acceptance Test) needs to be done in order to ensure a seemless integration flow.

- The endpoint for the *test environment* is: https://distributor.test.paysafecard.com/v1/
- The endpoint for the *production environment* is: https://distributor.paysafecard.com/v1/

# Voucher Print-out
![pod_voucher](http://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/5_API/xxx.PNG "PoD Voucher")

Each paysafecard printed voucher (via the POS terminal) must contain the following data:
|Name               |Description    
|---                |---                                                                 
|PIN-CODE           |The unique code used by the customer to pay at web shops.<br/><br/> 16 digits, numeric (preferably in 4 x 4 blocks).    
|SERIAL NUMBER      |The unique idenfication number used for card holder inquiries.<br/><br/> 16 digits, numeric (leading zeros may be cut).
|CARD TYPE          |The product identifier. For Pin-on-Deman the value: "classic" must be printed.
|FACE VALUE         |The face value of PIN sold(e.g. 10.00, 25.00, 50.00, 100.00, etc).
|CURRENCY           |The currency of the PIN sold (e.g. EUR, GBP, USD, PLN, etc).
|PRINT DATE         |Date and time-stamp of the voucher print-out at the POS (e.g. YYYY:MM:DD - HH:MM:SS).
|TERMINAL ID        |The POS identifier. Must be the value of the terminal ID provided in the `execute order` request.

**Important:** In addition, due to legal requirements the voucher print-out must contain a reference to the card issuer (e.g. PSC - Prepaid Services Company Ltd.),
the applicable T & C’s and the paysafecard Hotline-number as well as the e-mail contact for any inquiries.

Moreover, it should preferably contain also instructions for usage as shown in the sample above.

# Confidentiality
paysafecard assumes that the business partner will handle the PIN confidentially (it is only intended for the end customer).

**Important:** The busines partner shall not store the unencrypted PIN in any server, system, application, database, log file or errorlog where it may be subject to fraud.

If the business partner needs to store the PIN on its local systems for the voucher print-out, the PIN should be stored encrypted or in such a way that it is not easily accessible.

# Pin-on-Demand Flow
![transaction_flow_pod](http://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/5_API/xxxx.PNG "Pin-on-Demand")

# Group Pin-on-Demand Process
1. The customer requests a paysafecard PIN for an available face value at a POS

1. The POS employee selects the product and face value

1. An `execute order` request is made to the paysafecard system

1. paysafecard performs validation checks (credit limit, terminal limits) and a valid response is returned

1. A receipt is printed by the business partner system containing the PIN, serial number, product, face value, currency, date, terminal Id and the T & C’s and handed out to the customer

1. (**Optional**) A cancellation can be made via `cancel order` request

1. paysafecard performs validation checks (order status, date) and a valid response is returned

1. A cancellation recepit is printed by the business partner system and handed out to the customer

            "serial": 1850422961,
            "pin": "0381859494354749",
            "product_id": "CLASSIC"
        },
        "distributor_id": "0009402006",
        "order_id": "order_0009402006_XxVNh31ux78Y1eJRgGe6Y6qcbVNtnMbr",
        "product_id": "CLASSIC"
        }

# Cancelling and retrieving an order [/orders/{id}/]
The `order_id` of a successful `execute order` can be used to perform the two following `GET` and `DELETE` requests: 

## retrieve order [GET]
```
GET /orders/id/
```

The `retrieve order` request is used to retrieve the status and information of a previous order.

This request can be done at any time by the business partner.

### Order Status

|Value          |Description    |
|---            |---                                                                 |
|`DELIVERED`    |The order has been successfully processed.|
|`REJECTED`     |The order has failed due to a business or technical error.|
|`CANCELLED`    |The order has been successfully cancelled.|

+ Parameters

    + id: `order_0009402006_XxVNh31ux78Y1eJRgGe6Y6qcbVNtnMbr` (required) - Id of a successful `execute order` request

+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

               Authorization: Basic cHNjXzdoT2lCTFc4bURSNFl3TWdDV3RPZHU4SWZXNjdBanU=
    

+ Response 201 (application/json)
            
        {
        "amount": 10,
        "currency": "EUR",
        "card": {
            "amount": 10,
            "currency": "EUR",
            "serial": 1850423010,
            "product_id": "00028"
        },
        "distributor_id": "0009402006",
        "order_id": "order_0009402006_gfGMpuuhPHhipuIMff6qOQM0MHmv90yb",
        "product_id": "00028",
        "shop_id": "shopdid_test",
        "terminal_id": "test_terminal_123",
        "order_status": "DELIVERED",
        "delivery_type": "RETURN"
        }

## cancel order [DELETE]

```
DELETE /orders/id/
```

The `cancel order` request is used to undo a previous order. The paysafecard PIN associated with that order will be invalidated as well.

There is a timeout setting which can be individually configured and defines the maximum timeframe between the `execute order` 
and `cancel order` requests. This timeout is set by default to 5 minutes in the test environment and 20 days in the productive environment .

A `cancel order` request is successful if:
- The PIN has not been used (i.e, the order status is "DELIVERED")
- The timeout setting has not elapsed

**Note:** An order canceled using the `cancel order` request will not appear on the invoice to the busines partner. 
If the PIN is already invoiced, a credit note will be issued.

+ Parameters

    + id: `order_0009402006_XxVNh31ux78Y1eJRgGe6Y6qcbVNtnMbr` (required) - Id of a successful `execute order` request

+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

               Authorization: Basic cHNjXzdoT2lCTFc4bURSNFl3TWdDV3RPZHU4SWZXNjdBanU=
    

+ Response 201 (application/json)
            
        {
        "distributor_id": "0009402006",
        "order_id": "order_0009402006_gfGMpuuhPHhipuIMff6qOQM0MHmv90yb"
        }

# Cancelling a card [/cards/{sn}/]
The `cancel card` request is used to invalidate a paysafecard PIN, using the serial number.

**Note:** `cancel card` does not cancel a previous order, it only invalidates the paysafecard PIN.

Therefore `cancel card` shall only be used when the timeout setting for cancelling an order (20 days) has elapsed, as 
the cards will not appear in the reconciliation file and will result in a credit note.

A `cancel card` request is successful if:
- The PIN has not been used

## cancel card [DELETE]

```
DELETE /cards/sn/
```
+ Parameters

    + sn: `1850428953` (required) - Serial number of a successful `execute order` request

+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

               Authorization: Basic cHNjXzdoT2lCTFc4bURSNFl3TWdDV3RPZHU4SWZXNjdBanU=

# Group How to handle a lost response
In case the business partner does not get a response back to an `execute order` request, a lost response mechanism
shall be put in place to avoid order mismatches between the business partners system and paysafecard.

The below diagram explains the quickest solution to handle a lost response. 
![lost_response_pod](http://www.paysafecash.com/fileadmin/5_API/xxx.PNG "How to handle a lost response")

# Group Fraud Prevention and Limits
paysafecard assumes that the busines partner itself has implemented several mechanisms in order to detect and prevent fraud.

As an additional service, paysafecard provides a set of tools to support this:
- Several terminal limits are set and tf a certain terminal exceeds the allowed limit, the sales will be blocked.
- Terminal limits can be set globally, or on terminal level.
- Limit notification: when a specific terminal has reached its limit, both paysafecard and the business partner will be informed
    - paysafecard employees will receive a notification
    - The business partner will receive the error “TERMINALLIMIT_EXCEEDED” during the executing of the order.

When limits are reached the following procedure needs to be followed:
- The business partner must investigate the issue
- If no fraud is detected
    - Wait for the limit to reset or reset it manually using use the [Distributor Service Center](https://servicecenter.paysafecard.com/login/#/?resource=DistributorCenter&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fservicecenter.paysafecard.com%2Fdistributor%2F&client_id=c4172bc9-5e67-41c5-9278-4220ffca4c03)
    - Inform paysafecard and request a limit increase
- If fraud is detected, inform paysafecard to temporarily disable the terminal (on paysafecard side)

## Global and terminal limits
The Pin-on-Demand system allows configuration up to 5 terminal limits on global and on terminal level.
<br>
<br>
By default only one global maximum limit of 2400 EUR (in each currency) per 24 hours is applied. 
If this limit is reached the terminal will be temporarily blocked.
<br>
<br>
Clarification using the 24 hour limit as example:

The 24 hour limit is not limited to 1 day but can start at 16:00 and end at 16:00 on the following day.

When a terminal requests a paysafecard it receives a timestamp and the 24h limit is counted from this first time stamp. 
If a terminal does not sell for 2 days and reconnects on day 3 if will again receive a new timestamp (e.g. 11:00).
This also applies to all limits available.
<br>
<br>
Currently there are 5 Limits available:
|Limit|Time frame|
|---|---|
|Limit 1|24 hours|
|Limit 2|5 minutes|
|Limit 3|1 hour|
|Limit 4|30 minutes|
|Limit 5|12 hours|
<br>
<br>
Global and terminal specific limits can be negotiated with paysafecard. Please note:
- The limits should be configured so that in no case regular sales will be blocked. The limits are there for fraud prevention only.
- The limits will automatically release themselves as explained above. Alternatively the limits can be reset in the [Distributor Service Center](https://servicecenter.paysafecard.com/login/#/?resource=DistributorCenter&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fservicecenter.paysafecard.com%2Fdistributor%2F&client_id=c4172bc9-5e67-41c5-9278-4220ffca4c03).
- Please note that the terminal IDs sent to paysafecard must be **unique**. If different terminals are identified by the same ID, they count for one single terminal and will quickly run into limits. 

## Terminal limit CSV example
The business partner has the possibility to share a list of terminals with paysafecard upfront. In this file the limits for specific “high load” or “high risk” terminals can be communicated to paysafecard.

Requests for limit changes must be sent to [*distribution@paysafecard.com*]().
<br>
<br>
The filename of the .csv file must have the following format:

[distributorid].csv

Example: 0009382795.csv

D;39486;2000;500;;;
D;39487;3000;;1000;500;1500
EOF;5
```
**Note:** If one of the limits in the file is left empty, the general limits will apply.

## Temporary card locking
The temporary card locking guarantees that cancelling the order or the card (by either `cancel order` or `cancel card`) will succeed for the period that the lock is enabled.
(when a PIN is already used, the cancellation will fail.

If the feature is enabled (by default it is always disabled), all PINs sold over Pin-on-Demand will be temporarily locked, meaning they cannot be used by the customer who purchased the card until the temporary card lock time elapses. 

The recommended setting is 5 minutes, as most fraudulent card sale activities are detected within a rather short period of time, this feature should considerably lower the risk of POS fraud.

**Note:** Enabling this feature can only be done at paysafecard side.

If the temporary card locking is enabled, the business partner must add an extra text printed on the voucher, explaining that it takes some time before the customer can use the PIN.

# Group Reconciliation / Sales Reporting 
By default on a daily basis the, the business partner will receive a detailed sales report (in csv), containing all orders of last day. Orders with a successfully executed as well as cancelled orders will be included in the reconciliation file.

The reconciliation files will be available on a SFTP at 3:00 for the previous day and should be picked up by the business partner. The SFTP will be a paysafecard SFTP and the distributor will have to pick up the files from the paysafecard SFTP. 

The distributor should process these reports on a daily basis in order to prevent any inconsistencies between both systems. 
Should there be orders delivered to the distributor but not sold, the distributor should make a `cancel order` request, otherwise they will be invoiced based on the reconciliation file.

paysafecard will invoice all orders that have been successfully delivered.
